		<li class="q"><b>TIPS OF NEWS LETTER 1</b></li>
		<li class="a">
		<ul>
		<li><b>1</b>- Plan meals ahead of time (plan a menu AND shop to
			have ingredients on hand).</li>
		<li><b>2</b>- Simple recipes with few ingredients:<br><br>
a- Try simple pastas, stir-fries or one-pot dishes
(check out the recipes attached – they’re quick
and simple)!<br>
b- You can try more complicated recipes when you
have more time and as you gain confidence.

</li>
<li><b>3</b>- Add plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables:<br><br>
a- Add fruit to breakfast cereal.<br>
b- Have tinned baked beans (low-salt/no added salt
varieties) on toast.<br>
c- Wash and roughly cut up carrots, celery and snow
peas so they are ready to eat when you are in a
hurry. Most fruit just needs to be washed!
 </li>
 
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li class="q"><b>TIPS OF NEWS LETTER 2</b></li>
		<li class="a">
		<ul>
		<li><b>1</b>- Spend at least half of your food budget on ‘Eat Most’ foods
such as fruit, vegetables and legumes, bread and plain cereal
foods (pasta, rice, high fibre/low sugar cereals).
 </li>
 <li><b>2</b>- Spend 30% on ‘Eat Moderately’ foods such as lean meat,
chicken without skin, fish, eggs, nuts, milk, yoghurt, and cheese.
</li>
<li><b>3</b>- Spend less than 10% on ‘Eat Least’ foods that do not
provide many nutrients. These foods are often high in
fat, salt and/or sugar and include oils, butter/margarine,
condiments, chocolate, chips, sweet biscuits, cordials,
soft drinks, coffee, tea and alcohol.
</li>
<li><b>4</b>- Choose reduced fat products such as those labelled “25% Reduced Fat”. Make sure freezer and fridge items are not past their use-by date.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li class="q"><b>TIPS OF NEWS LETTER 3</b></li>
		<li class="a">5 ways to shop smart:
		<br>
		<ul>
		<li><b>1</b>- Write a shopping list. Use the menu planner we provided in Newsletter 2 to help you plan meals
and write your list before going shopping. Make sure you include a good variety and amount of
fruit and vegetables in your meals. Remember to try all colours of the rainbow!
</li>
		<li><b>2</b>- Choose fruit and vegetables in season. These are in good supply, cheaper and taste better. Use
the ‘Fruit and Vegetable Seasonality, Selection and Storage’ guide we’ve provided with this newsletter to help you.
</li>
		<li><b>3</b>- Tinned fruit and vegetables. Compare prices; choose tinned or frozen products sometimes if
these are cheaper than fresh. Remember to look for fruit in natural juice and for tinned low-salt
varieties of vegetables and legumes.
</li>
		<li><b>4</b>- Check your shopping docket. Check it regularly to see how you spend your food dollars.</li>
		<li><b>5</b>- Don’t shop when hungry. You will be more likely to impulse buy foods not on your shopping list.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li class="q"><b>TIPS OF NEWS LETTER 4</b></li>
		<li class="a">Here are some quick and simple ideas using basic
food items:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Pasta and Rice:</b><br>1- Combine cooked pasta with a pasta sauce – choose
a low-salt variety and add lots of vegetables.
<br>2- Add pasta into casseroles.
<br>3- Make fried rice using frozen vegetables.
</li>
<li><b>Creamed corn or baked beans:</b><br>1- Use as a filler for toasted sandwiches or have on toast. </li>
<li><b>Kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas:</b><br>1- Add these to any Bolognese sauce.<br>2- Combine these with salt-reduced tinned soup and
meat (optional) to make a casserole.
<br>3- Add tinned (and rinsed) chickpeas to salads.</li>
<li><b>Frozen vegetables:</b><br>1- Add frozen peas and corn to savoury mince; add
green beans and baby corn to stir-fries.
<br>2- Add to soups, curries or scrambled eggs – increases
the amount made and is a money- and time-saver!
</li>
<li><b>Tinned or frozen fruit:</b><br>1- Serve with low-fat yoghurt and nuts.<br>2- Use with low-joule jelly.</li>
</ul>

 </li>
		<li class="q"><b>TIPS OF NEWS LETTER 5</b></li>
		<li class="a">
		<ul>
		<li><b>1</b>- Know how much you have to spend on food. Work
out how much of your household budget you can
allocate to food. Keep a list on the fridge of foods that
you need to replace. You can use the shopping list we
provided with Newsletter 2.
</li>
		<li><b>2</b>- Avoid foods packaged in individual servings.
You pay more for the extra packaging. Pre-packaged
foods also tend to be more expensive than the homemade
alternative.
</li>
		<li><b>3</b>- Be aware of prices.
A higher price doesn’t always mean higher quality. Larger containers are not always cheaper if you don’t use all of the contents and have to throw them out. Also remember to check the unit price on the shelf to compare products. Have a look at the labels to the right. These are from
different sized packages of the same product.
</li>
